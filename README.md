# Student_Managment_Database
Student Management System (Python)

This C++ program manages student records using multiple source files for better organization and structure. The project reads and stores student information such as name, ID, GPA, and classification. It supports file input/output, displays formatted student data, and uses functions split across separate .cpp and .h files to show good coding practices, including:
	•	Use of structs to model student data
	•	File I/O to read/write student records
	•	Modular code architecture with function prototypes and definitions in separate files
	•	Basic data validation and formatting
