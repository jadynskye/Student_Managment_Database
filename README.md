# Student_Managment_Database
Student Management System (C++)

A C++ program that manages student records using multiple source files for better modularity and organization. The project reads and stores student information such as name, ID, GPA, and classification. It supports file input/output, displays formatted student data, and uses functions split across separate .cpp and .h files to demonstrate proper software design practices, including:
	•	Use of structs to model student data
	•	File I/O to read/write student records
	•	Modular code architecture with function prototypes and definitions in separate files
	•	Basic data validation and formatting
